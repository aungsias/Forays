## Introduction 

In an era where information is as volatile as it is abundant, the financial markets often find themselves at the mercy of public sentiment. News headlines, in particular, serve as a double-edged sword, possessing the power to both propel and plummet stock prices within moments. This study aims to explore this intricate relationship by focusing on Disney, a conglomerate whose diverse portfolio makes it a fascinating subject for this kind of analysis. The overarching questions guiding this study are: Which model is most apt at capturing headline sentiment, and can the sentiment derived from news headlines serve as a reliable indicator for Disney's stock performance?

## Objectives and Methods
The study unfolds in distinct yet interconnected phases, each with its own set of objectives. Initially, the focus is on determining the most apt sentiment analysis model. A collection of news headlines related to Disney serves as the dataset for this exploratory phase. Four machine learning models—TextBlob, BERT, Vader, and GPT-3—are employed for sentiment labeling. Their output is then qualitatively compared to my own evaluations to ascertain which model best captures the sentiment inherent in the headlines. 

Upon identying the most efficacious model, the study shifts to data segregation based on emotional categories. The aim here is to excavate the lexicon most frequently associated with each sentiment, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of the language patterns that drive public opinion. Concurrently, the events corresponding to these dominant words are analyzed to offer context.

The final objective is to conduct a correlation analysis, linking the refined sentiment data to Disney's stock performance over a defined timeframe. This serves as the empirical test for the overarching hypothesis: Can news headline sentiment act as a reliable predictor for stock market movement?
