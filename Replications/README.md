# Replicated Studies

The Replicated Studies folder within the Eigen-main Project Repository is dedicated to my attempts to recreate and understand existing research in finance, machine learning, and related fields. As part of my learning journey, I find value in meticulously reconstructing established studies to deepen my understanding and appreciate the underlying complexities.
