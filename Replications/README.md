# Replications

***Replications*** is dedicated to my attempts to recreate and understand existing research in finance, machine learning, and related fields. As part of my learning journey, I find value in reconstructing established studies to deepen my understanding and appreciate the underlying complexities. Each folder contains the reference paper from which I took inspiration.
