# Eigen
## Overview
Welcome to the Eigen-main repository. As a budding data scientist with a focus on finance, machine learning, and related fields, I've created this space to organize and share my ongoing work, experiments, and learnings. ***Eigen*** **is still in the process of being reorganized, and some content and structure may change.**

## Contents
### Self
In this section, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect my explorations in various methodologies and techniques. The projects are diverse and cover different aspects of finance and machine learning. Whether working on original concepts or building upon existing ideas, this section serves as a record of my hands-on experience and growth in the field.

### Replicated Studies
Recreating existing research is a crucial part of my learning process. In the Replicated Studies section, I attempt to verify and understand the findings of established works. By meticulously reconstructing these studies, I aim to deepen my understanding and appreciate the nuances and complexities of the subject matter.

### Work in Progress (WIP)
The Work in Progress section is a dynamic space that houses ongoing experiments, early-stage ideas, and projects under development. Here, I document the process of testing new concepts, iterating on designs, learning from mistakes, and refining my approach. It's a transparent look into the evolving nature of my work and a testament to the continuous learning journey.

### Custom Packages
As I've progressed in my work, I've found the need to develop custom packages to support various tasks and streamline processes. Each of them exist as pinned repositories within my profile, which you can find [here](https://github.com/aungsias).

***Eigen*** is a personal and evolving collection of my work, explorations, and learnings in finance and machine learning. It's a snapshot of my journey as a data scientist in the making, and I hope it serves as an interesting and valuable resource for others who share similar interests.

Feel free to explore, and thank you for taking the time to visit my repository.
