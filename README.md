## Eigen

Welcome to ***Eigen***, an evolving repository showcasing my work primarily in finance and machine learning, with occasional forays into other business and economics domains. Created to archive and disseminate my ongoing endeavors, ***Eigen*** is subject to regular and frequent updates, both in content and structure.

### Content

My portfolio is bifurcated into two distinct categories: large-scale (tagged with **L**) and small-scale endeavors (tagged with **S**). The former are comprehensive undertakings aimed at solving intricate business conundrums, often necessitating an interdisciplinary approach that amalgamates various sectors and knowledge bases. The latter serve as crucibles for hypothesis validation and the piloting of nascent concepts. Both are conduits for intellectual curiosity, designed to engender insights that are useful at the very minimum. Regardless of which you choose to peruse, I hope you walk away having learned at least something!

Feel free to explore, and thank you for taking the time to visit my repository.
