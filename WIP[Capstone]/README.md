## Abstract
In this project, I've engineered an adaptive machine learning algorithm that undergoes biannual recalibration to select the most accurate model for sector-based investment strategies. To counteract the pitfalls of over-forecasting, the algorithm employs a custom loss function that penalizes overpredictions. It comprehensively integrates a diverse range of financial indicators, including equity, debt, commodities, and market volatility. To enhance computational efficiency and model precision, I employed Principal Component Analysis for feature reduction. The model's robustness was substantiated through a 15-year backtest, during which it outperformed the SPY index by an estimated 91.85%. The finalized, vetted model has been encapsulated in a real-time dashboard, effectively translating intricate analytics into actionable market insights.
