## Abstract
In this project, I've engineered an adaptive machine learning algorithm that undergoes biannual recalibration to select the most accurate model for sector-based investment strategies. To counteract the pitfalls of over-forecasting, the algorithm employs a custom loss function that penalizes overpredictions. It comprehensively integrates a diverse range of financial indicators, including equity, debt, commodities, and market volatility. To enhance computational efficiency and model precision, I employed Principal Component Analysis for feature reduction. The model's robustness was substantiated through a 15-year backtest, during which it outperformed the SPY index by an estimated 91.85%. The finalized, vetted model has been encapsulated in a real-time dashboard.

## Introduction
Financial markets are inherently volatile and self-correcting, subject to externalities including but not limited to equities, debt instruments, commodities, and market sentiment. Traditional investment models often falter in this ever-changing landscape, and even adaptable strategies like sector rotation are usually limited by heuristic-based decision-making.

In this project, I've constructed a machine learning framework that operates as a "model of models." Rather than being a singular static model, it encompasses multiple machine learning algorithms. Every six months, each constituent model is retrained and assessed for performance. The best-performing model is then selected for the ensuing period, thereby ensuring that the framework remains attuned to the current market conditions. Each model selects a sector based on the mean predicted returns—the sector with the highest return is chosen. This framework is then backtested over a 15-year period to substantiate the framework's efficacy.

## Methodology
1. **Data Retrieval** - Retrieve prices for stocks and indices via `yfinance`.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Engineered features capture essential market variables: log returns, Sharpe ratios, and lagged features. Each feature is validated for stationarity. PCA mitigates multicollinearity.
3. **Target Engineering** - Sectoral returns are the primary targets, calculated as average log returns within each GICS Sector, providing a sector-focused strategy.
4. **"Model of Models" Architecture** - Utilizes multiple machine learning models. Biannually, models are retrained and assessed. The top-performing model is chosen via a custom loss function penalizing overpredictions. The sector indicated by this model is the investment focus.
5. **Backtesting** - The selected investment strategy is backtested, accounting for transaction costs, over a historical period to validate its efficacy.

## Data

The initial data pool encompassed daily prices of all 503 constituents of the S&P 500 (the tickers for which were scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)), along with four pivotal market indices: the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (VTI), the 
Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), and the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) used as proxies for the prices of stocks, commodities, bonds, and volatility. All prices were fetched using the [`yfinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) package. However, data gaps necessitated a refinement of this dataset and the analytical timeframe. Post-cleaning, the effective timeframe spanned from November 17, 2006, to September 11, 2023.

Further adjustment involved feature shifting to accommodate a 252-day forecast, equivalent to the number of trading days in a year. Consequently, the dataset's starting point for the model training was shifted to November 20, 2007. This maneuver ensured that the model's predictive variables align accurately with the forecast period, while still maintaining data integrity. This dataset provides a robust 16-year snapshot of market behavior, forming the bedrock for the machine learning framework.

## Feature & Target Engineering

### Features
The feature set is crafted to encapsulate diverse market indicators and sectoral insights. The following breaks the engineering process down:

#### Data Sources
- **S&P 500 Constituents**: 419 stocks with historical prices from February 6, 2006, to the present.
- **Market Indices**: Four key indices—Bonds, Commodities, Stocks, and Volatility—also spanning the same timeframe.
#### Feature Transformation and Enhancement
- **Log Returns**: Log returns were computed from prices to ensure stationarity of features.
- **Lookback Period**: A 10-day rolling window was used to calculate the Sharpe ratio for each feature, annualized with a factor of 252.
- **Lagged Features**: Created for each quarter (63 trading days) up to a year, capturing seasonality and longer-term trends.
#### Statistical Tests
- **ADF Test**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test confirmed all features to be stationary, a prerequisite for time-series modeling.
#### Dimensionality
The final dataset comprises 120 features, tested for stationarity. Initially, a heatmap of feature correlations revealed significant concerns regarding multicollinearity:

</p>

However, this issue was mitigated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) within the modeling pipelines.

The feature set aims to capture the snapshot of current market conditions and includes backward-looking indicators that help the machine learning models understand historical market behavior. Rolling computations were employed to preclude any data leakage from future observations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the predictive models.

### Targets
#### Sectoral Returns as Targets
The primary targets for this machine learning framework are the sectoral returns, which are calculated as the average log returns of the stocks within each GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Sector. These sectoral returns serve as the key performance indicators that the models aim to predict, thereby enabling a sector rotation strategy.

#### Calculation
- **Sector Identification**: Stocks are first categorized into their respective GICS Sectors.
- **Log Returns**: Following identification, stock prices are transformed into log returns.
- **Average Log Returns**: For each trading day, the average log returns of the stocks in each sector are computed to generate the sectoral returns.

#### Rationale
Sectoral returns offer an aggregated, yet nuanced, view of market trends. By focusing on sectoral returns as targets, the models can capture underlying economic factors affecting specific industries. This facilitates a more informed and targeted investment strategy, compared to using broader market indices and enables a strategy that can adapt to sector-specific trends and conditions.

## Modeling

### Asymmetric Loss Function

The 'Over-Under Error' loss function is specifically tailored for long-only investment strategies. In such strategies, investors can only buy and hold assets, making portfolios more susceptible to market downturns. Therefore, overpredictions in asset returns can lead to overexposure to certain assets, exacerbating potential losses. To mitigate this, the function is designed to penalize overpredictions more heavily. Mathematically, the loss is defined as:

$$\text{loss} = 
\begin{cases} 
\text{underpred penalty} \times \left| \text{residual} \right|^\alpha & \text{if residual} < 0 \\
\text{overpred penalty} \times \left| \text{residual} \right|^\alpha & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

The model is discouraged from making optimistic forecasts that could lead to overallocation of capital in risky assets.

### Models Used
The machine learning framework in this project comprises an ensemble of diverse models, each with distinct strengths tailored for financial market analysis. The models are preprocessed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture at least 80% of the variance in the data, and standard scaled for normalization. Below are the models and their configurations:

#### Regression Models
- **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 regularization, aiding in feature selection and handling multicollinearity.
    - Parameters: `alpha = 1` (strong regularization), `l1_ratio = 0.5` (balanced L1 and L2)
- **Support Vector (SVR)**: Uses an RBF kernel to capture non-linear relationships.
    - Parameters: `kernel = 'rbf'`, `c = 1` (moderate regularization), `gamma = 'auto'` (automatic kernal coefficient)
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees, capturing complex relationships and feature importance.
    - Parameters: `n_estimators = 100`
- **Gradient Boosting**: Boosting algorithm suitable for capturing non-linear relationships.
    - Parameters: `n_estimators = 100`
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting**: Optimized gradient boosting algorithm known for speed and performance
    - Parameters: `n_estimators = 100`

All regression models are configured with `random_state = 42` for reproducibility. 

#### Time Series Models
- **Naive**: Forecasts future returns based on the past six months of returns. Serves as a benchmark for performance.
- **ARIMAX**: Time series model that incorporates external variables to forecast future returns.

This ensemble enables the framework to adapt to a variety of market conditions, making it robust and versatile. The biannual recalibration process assesses the performance of these models, selecting the most effective one for the upcoming period.

### Model of Models
The framework employs a dynamic "Model of Models" architecture that re-trains each constituent model biannually, using data from the preceding six months. The model yielding the best Over-Under Error (OUE) score is selected as the lead model for the subsequent period. This chosen model identifies the most promising sector for investment based on the mean of its predicted returns. Stocks from the chosen sector are identified via their GICS segmentation. The resulting table is as such:

</p>

Following this, stock allocations are optimized based on mean-variance optimization methods, specifically the Maximum Sharpe Ratio, Risk Parity, and Minimum Variance optimizations. This cyclical recalibration ensures that the models and subsequently the investor's historical portfolio are updated with prevailing market conditions, optimizing both sector selection (via machine learning) and intra-sector asset allocation (via mean variance optimization).

## Mean-Variance Optimization

After the sector and its constituent stocks are identified through the "Model of Models" framework, the next step is to optimize the portfolio's asset allocation. This is accomplished using mean-variance optimization techniques, which aim to maximize returns while accounting for risk. Three specific optimization methods are therefore employed: Maximum Sharpe Ratio, Minimum Variance, and Risk Parity. Specifically, Maximum Sharpe Ratio optimizes for the best risk-adjusted return, Minimum Variance focuses on reducing portfolio volatility, and Risk Parity aims for equal risk contribution from each asset.

### Maximum Sharpe Ratio
The Maximum Sharpe Ratio method aims to find the portfolio allocation that maximizes the ratio of expected return to volatility. This is useful for helping investors achieve the highest return for a given level of risk. Mathematically, the Sharpe Ratio $S$ is defined as:

$$S = \frac{E[R_{p}] - R_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}$$

Where $E[R_{p}]$ is the expected portfolio return, $R_{f}$ is the risk-free rate, and $\sigma_{p}$ is the portfolio standard deviation. For simplicity, I've assumed $R_{f} = 0$, a negligible risk-free rate. The optimization problem is:

$$\text{Maximize } S \text{ subject to } \sum^n_{i=1}w_{i}=1$$

### Minimum Variance
The Minimum Variance method focuses solely on minimizing the portfolio's volatility. This is useful for risk-averse investors, who seek to assume the lowest possible risk profile in their portfolio. The optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as:

$$\text{Minimize } \sigma^2_{p} = w^{T}\Sigma{w} \text{ subject to } \sum^n_{i=1}w_{i} = 1$$

Where $w$ is the vector of the asset wieghts and $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of asset returns.

### Risk Parity
The risk parity method aims to allocate capital such that each asset contributes equally to the portfolio's overall risk. This is useful for investors who seek diversification across various risk sources. The optimization problem is to find weights $w$ that satisfy:

$$\text{Minimize }\sum^n_{i=1}
\Bigl(\frac{
    w \times \sigma_{i,p} - \text{Risk Parity Target}
}{\text{Risk Parity Target}}\Bigl)^2$$

Where $\sigma_{i,p}$ is the marginal contribution of asset $i$ to the portfolio risk, and the Risk Parity Target is $\frac{1}{n}$.

## Results

### Model Performance
Over the course of the biannual recalibrations, different models emerged as the preferred choice for sector selection.

- **Elastic Net**: Emerged as the most frequently selected model, chosen 13 times. It achieved an average Over-Under Error (OUE) of 0.092, indicating the best relative performance across diverse market phases.
- **ARIMAX**: Followed Elastic Net in preference, being selected 5 times. Despite fewer selections, it maintained a competitive average OUE of 0.101, confirming its efficacy in certain market conditions.
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)**: Chosen on 3 occasions, it posted an average OUE of 0.098. While less frequently chosen, its performance metrics indicate that it's a viable alternative under specific circumstances.
- **Random Forest**: Also chosen on 3 occasions and achieved an average OUE of 0.093, underscoring its potential utility as part of the ensemble.

### Sector Selection

The biannual model recalibration also provides insights into sector preferences over time:

- Energy: 9 occurrences
- Information Technology: 5 occurrences
- Materials: 4 occurrences
- Consumer Discretionary: 3 occurrences
- Real Estate: 3 occurrences
- Health Care: 3 occurrences
- Financials: 2 occurrences
- Utilities: 2 occurrences
- Communication Services: 1 occurrence

#### Sequential Sector Selection
It's noteworthy that once a sector is chosen, there's a proclivity for it to be selected in the subsequent recalibration cycle. For instance, "Energy" was consecutively chosen multiple times, especially from 2021 through 2023. This could suggest the model's ability to identify and capitalize on enduring trends within particular sectors, enhancing the investment strategy's temporal consistency.
