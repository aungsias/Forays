    "## Introduction\n",
    "The prediction of stock price movements is a well-studied problem in the fields of finance, economics, and computer science. Numerous methodologies have been developed to tackle this problem, ranging from traditional time-series analysis to complex deep learning models. Despite the advancement of sophisticated techniques, there remains a value in revisiting and understanding simple machine learning models, as they often provide interpretability and foundational insights that can be lost in more complex approaches.\n",

    "In this study, we focus on predicting the directional movement of Apple Inc.'s stock price using linear regression and logistic regression models. These models are chosen for their simplicity and fundamental role in the realm of predictive analytics. While they may not capture the intricate dependencies in financial data as effectively as more complex models, they serve as an essential starting point and a basis for comparison.\n",
