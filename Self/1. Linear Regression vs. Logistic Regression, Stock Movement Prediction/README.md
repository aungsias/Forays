## Introduction
The prediction of stock price movements remains a central challenge and a point of fascination in various disciplines, from finance and economics to machine learning. Complex methodologies, including deep learning and sophisticated time-series analyses, have advanced the field, often dominating the conversation. However, in the midst of this complexity, there is still a strong case for revisiting simpler models.

In this study, we turn our attention to linear and logistic regression models to predict the directional movement of Apple Inc.'s stock price. Though these models may seem almost rudimentary compared to the multifaceted techniques now available, they offer valuable insights. Simplicity can provide clarity, interpretability, and a connection to foundational principles that might be lost in more intricate approaches. The goal here is not to overshadow the advanced models but to understand the basic ones, recognize their limitations, and appreciate their role in the broader context of predictive analytics.

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room

In financial time series data, autocorrelation can complicate modeling and forecasting. This statistical property, where a stock's price today might be closely related to its price in recent days or weeks, undermines the assumption that observations are independent. To address this challenge, our analysis will utilize a shorter timeframe for both training and testing. By limiting the period of analysis and employing logarithmic returns, we aim to diminish the effect of autocorrelation, thus creating a more reliable model. This decision enables a focus on more immediate relationships in the data, without the potential distortion caused by lingering long-term dependencies.
